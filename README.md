Question 1: What is the keyboard interaction missing?
Ans:
Keys for navigation:
ArrowDown: Shift attention to the following accordion button.

ArrowUp: Shift attention to the accordion button that came before it.

Home: Shift your attention to the first accordion key.

End: Shift attention to the final accordion button.

Without these, keyboard-based users would not be able to efficiently switch between accordion portions.

Question 2: What is the ARIA missing?
Ans:
The aria-expanded property indicates if the accordion button is collapsed (false) or expanded (true). Screen readers are unable to indicate the toggling status without this.

Aria-controls: Assists screen readers in recognizing connections by connecting the accordion button to the relevant content area.

Aria-hidden: Indicates if assistive technology can see the accordion content (false) or if it is hidden (true).

role="region": Gives screen readers improved navigational signals by designating the accordion content as a landmark region.
